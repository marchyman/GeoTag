Feature Requests:

* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

* When the Photos app opens up for extensions, I hope GeoTag will be there to
  take advantage of it!  This has become my favorite program in just a few
  hours of use.  [Note: I expect apple to add a map interface to Photos.]
  
* Would it be worth putting in the preferences or somewhere the ability
  to put in a tag to indicate that the photo has GPS data in it.   On a
  save if GPS data is there it also saves the Tag.  Just an idea.

* Some of my photos don't have the correct Date/Time.  It would be nice if you
  could use GeoTag 3 to also update this for one or more photos.

* Multithread load and save

* Manual lat/long entry

* Preference option for lat/long output format.
  d.ddddddd # degrees and fractions of a degree (current format)
  d m.mmmmm # degrees and minutes
  d m s     # degrees, minutes, and seconds
