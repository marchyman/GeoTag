## 5.5

### Updates

- Make the number of minutes used to match images around track log endpoints 
  a program setting that can be changed by the user. The setting used to be
  fixed at 6 hours. The new default is 120 minutes.
- Update City, State, Country, and Country Code metadata whenever an image
  location is changed.
- exiftool version 13.25

### Bug Fixes

- (5.5.3) Fix state not updating in HEIC files.
- undo/redo is again working
- GeoTag GPX file waypoint parsing bug fix from bhostetler18

### Known Issues

- undo/redo menu items are always enabled, even when there are no undo or
  redo actions that could be performed. The menu titles are also not updated
  for the action to be performed.
- There is a short delay between clicking on the map and a map pin being
  placed.
- When showing pins for all selected locations the red (most selected) pin
  may be hidden by the pin of another location near by unless the zoom level
  is such that both locations are slightly separated on the map.
- when changing the selection to an image that has a location some of the pin
  may off the map view.  In an extreme case only the point of the pin is on
  the map and can not be seen. If you do not see a pin when you expect to
  zoom out slightly.
- paste sometimes not enabled after cut. Can not reproduce on demand.

## 5.4

### Updates

- Pin view options now available in the Map context menu in addition to the
  View menu.
- ExifTool version 13.01
- Code structure changes

### Bug Fixes

- If multiple GPX track logs contained timestamps within 6 hours of an image
  timestamp the image might have been assigned an incorrect location when
  the "Locn from track" function was used.

### Known issues

- undo/redo is broken. Repeatedly doing an undo will instead undo/redo the
  last action.  Redo does nothing. I discovered this after 5.4 was
  released.
- undo/redo menu items are always enabled, even when there are no undo or
  redo actions that could be performed. The menu titles are also not updated
  for the action to be performed.
- There is a short delay between clicking on the map and a map pin being
  placed.
- When showing pins for all selected locations the red (most selected) pin
  may be hidden by the pin of another location near by unless the zoom level
  is such that both locations are slightly separated on the map.

  may off the map view.  In an extreme case only the point of the pin is on
  the map and can not be seen. If you do not see a pin when you expect to
  zoom out slightly.
- paste sometimes not enabled after cut. Can not reproduce on demand.

## 5.3.1

### Updates

- Hitting the return key after entering text in the map search field will
  automatically select the first search result and position the map at
  that location.
- ExifTool version 12.87

### Bug fixes

- Bug fix: locations selected by clicking on map are applied to all selected
  images, not only the most selected item.
- Bug fix: recenter map when pasting lat/lon into selected item
- Bug fix: Apply search results locations to any selected images and zoom
  into the location when necessary.
- Bug fix: Don't attempt to update the GPS timestamp when the image does
  not have timestamps.
- Bug fix: Don't limit map search result to address types as that hid
  otherwise valid search results.
- Bug fix: allow location updates to PNG files again. Whatever limitation
  that caused support to be removed in 2020 no longer applies.

### Known Issues

- undo/redo menu items are always enabled, even when there are no undo or
  redo actions that could be performed. The menu titles are also not updated
  for the action to be performed.
- There is a short delay between clicking on the map and a map pin being
  placed.
- When showing pins for all selected locations the red (most selected) pin
  may be hidden by the pin of another location near by unless the zoom level
  is such that both locations are slightly separated on the map.

  may off the map view.  In an extreme case only the point of the pin is on
  the map and can not be seen. If you do not see a pin when you expect to
  zoom out slightly.

## 5.3

### Updates

- Images can be selected from your Photos Library.  Timestamps and locations
  can be changed and "written" back to the library. The original file is not
  modified. No backups are made.
- Map pins can not be dragged. Click on the desired location to move a pin.
- Copied/Cut coordinates are now in the same format as selected in GeoTag
  settings.
- Map configuration options are now in a map context (right click) menu.
- At an appropriate zoom level you are given the option to use a 3D map
  representation.  Look for the "3D" button near the upper right corner of
  the map.
- The last 10 map searches are saved across GeoTag runs.
- Updated app icon to match current guidelines re size and rounded corners
- You can "fuzzy" search for images in the table by name.
- Copy and paste format changed: the coordinate separator is now ", ".
  A separator of "| " is also accepted for backward compatibility.
  Example (lat, lon, elevation): 38.530196, -123.214981, 466.38
  Elevation is optional.

### Bug Fixes

- Bug Fix: cancelling a search no longer looks up whatever happended to
  be typed into the search bar.
- Bug Fix: Changing the map style no longer repositions the map.
- Bug Fix: Coordinate format changes take effect immediately in the image table.
- Bug Fix: Data in XMP sidecar files was not read unless the XMP file was in
  a folder that was opened or the XMP file itself was explicity opened.
  Note: xmp files can no longer be selected to open.
- Bug Fix: Duplicate image processing does more than give a warning.
- Bug Fix: extraneous map centering removed
- Bug Fix: Time zone handling when adjusting for zones with a non-zero number
  of minutes east of GMT.

## 5.2

### Updates

* The major performance bottleneck has been found and fixed.  Valid, but
  in hindsight poorly thought out code triggered massive processing to
  keep the user interface in sync.  Because the processing was being done
  in an Apple framework it took much trial and error before I figured
  out what, exactly, I was doing to cause the issue. A few minor performance
  enhancements were made while looking for the big one.
* Latitude/Longitude and Timestamp keyboard updates are now done in an
  inspector.  Control/right click on an entry and select Edit... or click
  on the inspectory icon (circled i) to show the inspector for the selected
  item.
* keyboard driven pasteboard actions are now supported in the location
  and map search fields.
* Thumbnail images can now be up to 1024x1024 in size.  They were limited
  to 512x512.
* Table columns can be moved.
* The prompt to save images when GeoTag quits will no longer be displayed
  when no changes would be made.
* Exiting full screen mode no longer leaves the image and map panes out
  of the window.
* ExifTool version 12.77

## 5.1

### Updates

* Add option to always create sidecar (XMP) files when updating images.
* Update both images of a raw/jpeg pair when the location of one of the
  paired images changes. This only applies if both images of the pair were
  opened and enabled or if updates are written to a sidecar file.
* Add "Report a bug..." to the help menu.  Selecting this will open the GeoTag
  github issues page in your browser.
* ExifTool version 12.62

### Bug Fixes

* Performance improvement when opening large number of images.
* Do not clear window changed indicator when there are save errors.
* GPS Timestamp written to sidecar files sometimes included a timezone
  instead of being a UTC/GMT relative timestamp.
* Crash that could occur when opening the Setting window.
* Sidecar file backups would sometimes fail.
* image thumbnail could fail to show until the selection changed.

## 5.0

### Updates

* Set elevation/altitude when assigning locations from track logs.
* User option to enable/disable the jpeg part of a raw/jpeg pair
* User option to add a finder tag to updated images.

* The function to interpolate image location was removed.
* (internal) better performance using structured concurency where possible
* (internal) Exiftool version 12.55
* (internal) User Interface code re-written to use SwiftUI

## 4.99.x (Version 5 Beta Releases)

### Fixes/changes since initial Beta

* Show the correct "current time zone" in the Select zone window.
* Set the file modification timestamp the the date/time the image was
  taken when requested.  GeoTag was only preserving the file time
  which may have been other than the original time when Set File Modification
  Times was enabled.
* Sort the table of images using the current sort order when adding new images.
* Re-build app icon using the new pin shape and color.
* Fix pin colors when showing pins for all selected items.

* do not apply track log points when time +/- 6 hours of image time
* Fixed multiple sheets when loading good and bad track logs
* Fixed crash -- missing environment object when scrolling table
* Open With now works
* Use custom pin that changes during drag operations. Replaces deprecated code.
* fixed table view bugs, a side effects of fixing the table crash
* internal changes
  - remove "Publishing changes from within view updates is not allowed" warnings
    due to SwiftUI sometimes having problems binding to Published variables.
  - Depricated code to change map types removed.  Now using map configuaration

Known Bugs

* Right pane divider location on start -- partially fixed
* When Metal validation enabled program crashes when divider is moved

## 4.15

### Updates

* Add a do not backup option to program preferences.  Not recommended, but
  provided for those who know they always have backups of all their images and
  see no need to create any more.

* Ignore jpg/jpeg files that are part of a raw+jpg pair. Such files are only
  ignored when both files of a pair are in the same folder and are opened
  at the same time.

* Exiftool 12.41; adds support for OM-1 (OM Digital Systems)

## GeoTag 4.14

### Update

* Exiftool version 12.39

### Bug Fix

* Date/Times could only be modified.  A Date/Time could not be assigned
  to an image that did not have a create date.  Fixed.

## GeoTag 4.13

### Bug Fix

* The map search bar got buried under the map and somehow I didn't notice
  before releasing 4.12.

* Resizing window did bad things

## GeoTag 4.12

### New Features

* Add the ability to adjust the Time Zone used by the code that matches image
  timestamps to track log timestamps when assinging locations from a track
  log.  Edit -> Adjust Time Zone is the new menu item to initiate selection
  of a Time Zone. It is only necessary to adjust time zones when the Camera
  date/time does not match the date/time of the computer running GeoTag.

* Change display color of changed but not yet saved fields to green. This
  helps identify work in progress when changing the location or timestamp
  of several images.

* ExifTool 12.30

### Bug Fix

* Remove broken help page.  Instead link to the help information on
  www.snafu.org.

## GeoTag 4.11

### New Feature

* ExifTool version 12.21

### Bug Fix

* Pull date/time and existing location information from the image file
  even when an XMP file exists.  The same metadata from an XMP file, if
  present, will have priority and override the metadata from the image file.

## GeoTag 4.10

### New Feature

* Add preference item to preserve the original image file
  modification time when updating GeoLocation data.

* Add "Discard tracks" under the File menu. All tracks are cleared from the map.

* Allow paste into change timestamp and update location windows.

* Paste into images when not using the Update Location window now has a new
  format.  The format is "lat | lon" where lat and lon may be one of the
  following formats.

  -dd.dddd R            Coordinate in degrees
  -dd mm.mmmm R         Coordinate in degrees and minutes
  -dd mm ss.ssss R      Coordinate in degrees, minutes, and seconds

  S latitudes and W longitudes can be indicated by a negative number
  of degrees or the appropriate reference (R) value.  It is an error if both
  are used.  Degree (°), Minute ('), and Second (") marks are optional
  and ignored if found at the end of a value.

* Update to exiftool 12.12

* Compiled to also run on Apple Silicon 

## GeoTag 4.9

### New Feature

* mark files that could not be backed up or updated.
  files in red could not be updated by exiftool
  files in orange could not be saved in the backup folder

* new right-click menu option -- Show in Finder

* new preference -- change the width of tracks.

### Bug Fix

* Update existing track color (and width) when the preference changes.

## GeoTag 4.8

### New Feature

* update CreateDate as well as Date/Time Original.  Dates are updated only
  when the user modifies the image timestamp.

* Warn the user if the Backup/Save folder contains more than 500 MB of images
  or if the images were added to the folder more than 7 days ago.
  
* gray out png files.  Exiftool can handle metadata in PNG files but
  finder/macOS can't.
  
* update exiftool to version 11.91

### Bug Fix

* Remember the column/sort direction when a user picls a column to order the
  images in the table. Sort by the remembered value when new images are
  opened.

* update the script use to build a release dmg

## GeoTag 4.7.1

### Bug Fix

* when changing or setting dates of a image only change/set the
  -DateTimeOriginal tag.  Leave the other dates alone.

## GeoTag 4.7

### New Feature

* Change map search to find Points of Interest in addition to addresses.

* When doing a map search the searched location will be applied to all
  selected images.  In previous versions a search would only position the
  map.

### Bug Fix

* Replace a call to fatalerror with an Alert notifying the user that a file
  could not be processed.

* Fix possible off-by-one when searching for a track point by timestamp

### Known Bugs

* [Developer bug] Trying to run any test cases will crash Xcode.  This may be
a side effect of running the Catalina Beta.

## GeoTag 4.6.2

* 4.6.2 is the same as 4.6.1, but with a notarized dmg file for hassle free
  installation on macOS Catalina.

## GeoTag 4.6.1

### Bug Fix

* Some GPX files may not contain any tracks.  Tell the user if no tracks were
  found and otherwise ignore the file.

* The GPS Date/Time value was not being updated in sidecar files.

## GeoTag 4.6

### New Features

* If a sidecar file exists metadata can be read from and updated metadata
  written to the sidecar file instead of the image file. This is controlled
  by a new preference item.  Files in the same folder as the image file with
  the same name but with an extension of ".xmp" are assumed to be sidecar files.
  
* The presence of a sidecar file is indicated by a '*' following the image name.

* heic (iPhone) image file updates are now supported.

* Add a preference item that controls coordinate display formats.   Latitude
  and longitude can be displayed in one of three forms:
  - dd.ddddd
  - dd° mm.mmmm' N (or S, E, W depending upon coordinate)
  - dd° mm' ss.ss" N (or S, E, W depending upon coordinate)

* Location coordinates can be entered by double clicking on either the
  latitude or longitude of an entry.  Coordinates can be entered in
  degrees, degrees and minutes, or degrees, minutes, and seconds.
  Use of °, ', and " indicators are optional.

* Reading image metadata has been moved from the main queue. As a result opening
  a large number of images should be slightly faster.

* Preferences window changed.  Textual explanations of buttons have been
  moved to tool tips.

* ExifTool version 11.44

### Bug fixes

* Pin dragging is working again

* Updated image locations could sometimes be written with the wrong longitude
  reference.

* fix crash that occured in the app was launched by dragging images onto
  the app icon.

## GeoTag 4.5

### New Features

* center the map (more or less) on a track when the track is opened.
* Add preference to select track color for GPX tracks.
* change GPX file loaded notification to a sheet attached to the GeoTag main
  window.  Dual monitor users would sometimes find the pop-up previously used
  on the wrong monitor, i.e. no the monitor they were looking at.
* Verify a file can be written by exiftool. If not do not allow attempted
  updates that will fail during a save.   HEIC (iPhone) files are not writable.
* exiftool 11.32
* swift 5

### Bug Fixes

* fix error that caused a "could not save images" alert even when all image
  data had been saved.
* fix race condition when checking that all images had been saved
* handle GPX logs that include milliseconds in the location timestamp.
* Fix location interpolition issues related to time zones.
* Fix backup file naming. Examples:
  foo.bar.jpg would be backed up as foo.bar.jpg the first time.
  foo.bar.jpg would be backed up as foo-1.bar.jpg the second time.
  The backup file name should have been foo.bar-1.jpg

## GeoTag 4.4

### New Features

* GeoTag can now read GPS track logs in the format of a GPX file and display
  tracks on the map.  This can help locate places where pictures were taken.
  Use Open (⌘-O) to select GPX files.  GPX files can also be dragged onto the
  table.
* Image location can be updated from a GPS track logs.  Select the images to
  update and use ⌘T, Edit -> Locn from track, or crtl-click -> Locn from track.
  Note: this can be time consuming depending upon the number of images selected
  and the number of track log point loaded.
* Images can now be opened with GeoTag.  You can select one or more images in
  finder and then right click and select the "Open With" option.  GeoTag will
  be one of app choices.
* Double clicking on a row in the table will open a window to update the
  timestamp of the image.  Timestamps are not changed during cut/copy/paste
  operations.
* A time delta can be applied to multiple images.   Select the images and
  use ⌘T, Edit -> Modify Date/Time, or ctrl-click -> Modify Date/Time.  Enter the
  new time for the selected image.  A time delta between the new and the existing
  date/time will be calculated. That delta is then applied to all selected items.
* Images can be selected and the map can be panned/zoomed while saving images.
  Images locations can not be edited until the save is complete.
* The last 10 map searches are saved across program runs. When Clicking on the
  search box saved search strings are indicated by a down arrow next to the
  Q icon. Click on the arrow next to open the menu of saved search strings.
* ExifTool version 11.10
* (internal) Swift 4.2, Xcode 10

### Bug fixes

* undoing a location update on an image that did not have a previous location
  resulted in a location of lat: 0, lon: 0. This has been fixed to restore the
  image to its "no location assigned" state.
* undoing all actions did not clear the window modified flag causing a "please
  save" message when window was closed/application terminated.
* No more beachball when saving large number of images.  Multiple images
  are saved in parallel, but the save process can still be quite slow.
* If GeoTag (or your computer) crashed with files opened and one or more of the
  opened files was moved to a different folder GeoTag would crash on attempts
  to re-open the file.

## GeoTag 4.3

### New Features

* Add ability to sort the table of images by column.  Clicking on a column
  header will sort the table by the contents of that column.  Clicking again
  will change the sort direction.
* ExifTool version 10.94

### Bug Fixes

* handle the case where the same file name is used for two images located in
  different folders.
* remove GPS date and time stamps when a location is removed.

## GeoTag 4.2

### New Features

* Update GPS Date and Time tags when updating location.   GPS timestamps are
  in GMT.  The procedure assumes the date and time the image was taken was correct
  for the time zone.  If your camera was set to the wrong time zone or set to
  UTC/GMT the GPS timestamp will be incorrect.  This feature is only enabled when
  the 'Update GPS Date/Time stamps' button is checked in program Preferences.
  **This feature is only available on macOS 10.11 or later**
  When running GeoTag on earlier versions of macOS the button state is ignored.
* ExifTool 10.76

### Bug Fixes

* Fix display of error reason when a backup folder can not be selected

## GeoTag 4.1 includes the following.

### New Features

* Map search
* Image backup handling
* Exiftool 10.67
* MIT Software License

### Bug Fixes

* GPS info validation
* pin no longer placed when double clicking on map
* pin no longer placed when dragging map
* Changes for Swift 4.0

## GeoTag 4.0

### New Features:

* Apple maps replace Google maps
* Exiftool is now built in
* Sandboxed for better security
* Image loading is many times faster
* Currently coded in Swift 3

## GeoTag 3.5

### New Features:

* (internal) update code to use Swift 2

### Bug fixes:

* Disable App Transport Security so the maps will load in OS X 10.11
  El Capitan

* location highlighting error fixed.  When assigning a location and then
  selecting another image the latitude and longitude are re-displayed in
  the standard color.

* map search box relocated such that it no longer covers the button used
  to exit street view.

## GeoTag 3.4

### New Features:

* Folders can now be dragged and dropped into the table. All non-duplicate files
  in the folder (and sub folders) will be added to the table for geolocation
  editing.

* Folders can also now be selected in the File -> Open dialog.

* Add ⌘K as a shortcut for the Clear image list menu option.  The command
  is ignored if any of the items in the list have been edited and not saved.

* Added a GeoTag preference to select a folder where original files will be
  saved in addition to the Trash. Files in the optional save folder with the same
  name as an image to be saved will NOT be overwritten.

* GeoTag can assign locations to images by interpolating between two points.
  See the operating instructions for more info.

### Bug fixes:

* Window size and split pane locations are now saved.   Restarting GeoTag
  should use the same layout as the previous invocation.

* When using drag-and-drop GeoTag enabled the drop only when the cursor was
  beyond the end of the table.  It will now allow a drop anywhere in the table.
  The added images will still be appended to the end of the table, not placed
  at the cursor location.

* Fixed crash that would occur when dragging movie files into GeoTag

* Fix handling of file systems that do not support the trash.  When the original
  version of an edited file can not be moved to the trash GeoTag will now display
  a warning and leave the original file in its original folder with '_original'
  appended to its name.   The warning will only be displayed once per GeoTag
  execution.

* Minimum window size reduced to fit on the smaller Macbook Air

## GeoTag 3.3

* Add a search field to the map.   Entering the name of a location and then
  hitting enter or clicking on the find button will center the map on the
  searched for location.

* Internal changes to match the requirements/features of Swift 1.2.  Xcode
  version 6.3 or later required to build from source.

## GeoTag 3.2

* Fix a class of bugs that would cause a crash when decoding optional image
  properties than weren't present.

## GeoTag 3.1

* Added ability to resize the image table, image, and map panes.  Otherwise
  the same as 3.0.

## GeoTag 3.0

This is a complete re-write of GeoTag for Mavericks and later

* written in swift
* Assumes exiftool exists in your run path
* Starting map location/zoom level may be saved
* Faster image loading

Use version 2.2 if your Mac is running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) though OS X 10.8
(Mountain Lion).  Use version 1.8 if your Mac is running OS X version 10.5
(Leopard)  or earlier
