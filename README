## GeoTag for macOS -- macOS 10.12 or later

GeoTag is a free OS X single window application that allows you to update image
metadata with geolocation tags by selecting one or more images then panning and
zooming within a a map to the place the image was recorded. Clicking on the map
will add the location to the selected photos.  Clicking on a new location will
change the geolocation for the selected photos.  Zoom in on the map and fine
tune the location with a click.  The built in ExifTool utility is used to write
location data to the images when you save your changes.  ExifTool only modifies
image metadata -- your image pixels are not touched.

See <http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/> for information about
ExifTool. **ExifTool is built in to GeoTag.**

GeoTag is available as a [homebrew](http://brew.sh) cask.  Homebrew users
can use the command `brew cask install geotag` to install.

Version 4.4.x is the latest version.  It workes on macOS 10.12 or later. Version
4 uses Apple maps.

## Work in progress

### New Features

* If a sidecar file exists metadata can be read from and updated metadata
  written to the sidecar file instead of the image file. This is controlled
  by a new preference item.  Files in the same folder as the image file with
  the same name but with an extension of ".xmp" are assumed to be sidecar files.

* The presence of a sidecar file is indicated by a '*' following the image name.
  
* Reading image metadata has been moved from the main queue. As a result opening
  a large number of images should be slightly faster.

* Preferences window changed.  Textual explanations of buttons have been
  moved to tool tips.

### Bug fixes

* Updated image locations could sometimes be written with the wrong longitude
  reference.

* fix crash that occured in the app was launched by dragging images onto
  the app icon.

## GeoTag 4.5

### New Features

* center the map (more or less) on a track when the track is opened.
* Add preference to select track color for GPX tracks.
* change GPX file loaded notification to a sheet attached to the GeoTag main
  window.  Dual monitor users would sometimes find the pop-up previously used
  on the wrong monitor, i.e. no the monitor they were looking at.
* Verify a file can be written by exiftool. If not do not allow attempted
  updates that will fail during a save.   HEIC (iPhone) files are not writable.
* exiftool 11.32
* swift 5

### Bug fixes

* fix error that caused a "could not save images" alert even when all image
  data had been saved.
* fix race condition when checking that all images had been saved
* handle GPX logs that include milliseconds in the location timestamp.
* Fix location interpolition issues related to time zones.
* Fix backup file naming. Examples:
  foo.bar.jpg would be backed up as foo.bar.jpg the first time.
  foo.bar.jpg would be backed up as foo-1.bar.jpg the second time.
  The backup file name should have been foo.bar-1.jpg

### Known Bugs

* Setting the date of an image outside of the range of 1970-2034 may result in
  an incorrect GPS Date Stamp.  This is a limitation of how GeoTag, ExifTool,
  and macOS libraries handle date and time.  One hopes that the year 2034 limit
  will eventually be removed ;)
* You can not re-position a pin by dragging the pin.  Instead click on the
  desired location

### Other 4.x Features and bug fixes

* GeoTag can now read GPS track logs in the format of a GPX file and display
  tracks on the map.  This can help locate places where pictures were taken.
  Use Open (⌘-O) to select GPX files.  GPX files can also be dragged onto the
  table.
* Image location can be updated from a GPS track logs.  Select the images to
  update and use ⌘L, Edit -> Locn from track, or crtl-click -> Locn from track.
  Note: this can be time consuming depending upon the number of images selected
  and the number of track log point loaded.
* Images can now be opened with GeoTag.  You can select one or more images in
  finder and then right click and select the "Open With" option.  GeoTag will
  be one of app choices.
* Double clicking on a row in the table will open a window to update the
  timestamp of the image.  Timestamps are not changed during cut/copy/paste
  operations.
* A time delta can be applied to multiple images.   Select the images and
  use ⌘T, Edit -> Modify Date/Time, or ctrl-click -> Modify Date/Time.  Enter the
  new time for the selected image.  A time delta between the new and the existing
  date/time will be calculated. That delta is then applied to all selected items.
* Images can be selected and the map can be panned/zoomed while saving images.
  Images locations can not be edited until the save is complete.
* The last 10 map searches are saved across program runs. When Clicking on the
  search box saved search strings are indicated by a down arrow next to the
  Q icon. Click on the arrow next to open the menu of saved search strings.
* Add ability to sort the table of images by column.  Clicking on a column
  header will sort the table by the contents of that column.  Clicking again
  will change the sort direction.
* Update GPS Date and Time tags when updating location.   GPS timestamps are
  in GMT.  The procedure assumes the date and time the image was taken was
  correct for the time zone.  If your camera was set to the wrong time zone or
  set to UTC/GMT the GPS timestamp will be incorrect.  This feature is only
  enabled when the 'Update GPS Date/Time stamps' button is checked in program
  Preferences. **This feature is only available on macOS 10.11 or later**
* handle the case where the same file name is used for two images located in
  different folders.
* remove GPS date and time stamps when a location is removed.
* Map searching -- position map by name of city/street/etc.
* Image backup handling (see below)
* Fix display of error reason when a backup folder can not be selected
* pin no longer placed when double clicking on map
* pin no longer placed when dragging map
* GPS info validation
* handle the case where the same file name is used for two images located in
  different folders.
* undoing a location update on an image that did not have a previous location
  resulted in a location of lat: 0, lon: 0. This has been fixed to restore the
  image to its "no location assigned" state.
* undoing all actions did not clear the window modified flag causing a "please
  save" message when window was closed/application terminated.
* No more beachball when saving large number of images.  Multiple images
  are saved in parallel, but the save process can still be quite slow.
* If GeoTag (or your computer) crashed with files opened and one or more of the
  opened files was moved to a different folder GeoTag would crash on attempts
  to re-open the file.

### Image Backups

* A "backup folder" location is required.  If a backup folder is not configured
  when GeoTag starts the program will open the preferences window for you to
  select a location.
* When saving geo location data to an image a copy of the un-edited image is
  placed in the backup folder. If an image of the same name exists in that folder
  a numbered suffix will be added to the name.   The name with the highest
  numbered suffix is the most current backup (usually).
* If the image file can not be copied to the backup location Geolocation
  information will not be saved.   Better to be safe than sorry.

### General Note

The functions provided by GeoTag exist in current versions of iPhoto, Aperture
(RIP), and Lightroom.  Some still find the application useful for geolocation
tagging photos in the field.  Photos (OSX 10.10.3 and later) will let you modify
existing location metadata but not add location data to an image. If necessary
use GeoTag to add location metadata **before** importing the images into Photos.

### Operating Instructions:

*See <https://www.snafu.org/GeoTag/NewGeoTagHelp/> for more information.*

Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or ⌘O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files.  Such files can not be modified.   Dragging
or opening a folder will add all the files in the folder and any subfolders.

Select one or more images. When selecting multiple images the last image
selected is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the window).
Its location (if any) is marked on the map.  When multiple rows are selected
the latitude and longitude of the image displayed in the image well and marked
on the map location will be shown in yellow.

Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can be changed by clicking on the desired location. Hitting the delete key
will remove location information from all selected images.  You can Undo/Redo
image location changes.

Double click to zoom in.  Or use the pinch gestures to zoom in and out.

GeoTag can interpolate positions for images between two images with assigned
locations.   This might be useful where you know starting and ending locations
and would like to approximate where on the straight path between the two
other images may have been taken.  To use this feature:

* Load a series of images to be tagged into GeoTag
* Assign a location to the first image in your series of images.
* Assign a location to the last image in your series of images.
* Select all images in the series from first to last.
* Use the menu item "Edit -> Interpolate" to assign location to the
  intermediate images in your series of images.

Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported. You
can also use street view, but... the latitude and longitude of a map marker
in street view do not match the same marker on one of the other three map
views.

If you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the map type, location, and zoom level by clicking on the *Save Map Location*
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.

You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.

The original versions of images that have been updated are saved are in a
backup folder.  The backup folder may be changed using GeoTag Preferences.
The first time GeoTag is run it will prompt you to select a backup folder.
Images updates can not be saved until a backup folder is selected.

Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Interpolate, and Clear Image List can be accessed from
a pop up menu by right clicking on an entry in the list.
